## HealthHub - Fitness & Health Care Web-Application

In today's fast-paced world, there is a growing concern regarding the declining levels of physical activity and overall health. To address these issues, the HealthHub - Fitness & Health Care Web-Application has been developed. The application's core features include the ability for users to effortlessly identify fitness activities within a 5km radius of their location and enroll in them based on tailored recommendations 
provided on the website. Furthermore, the application will generate diet plan recommendations based on the user's body mass index (BMI), promoting a wellrounded approach to health management. To enhance user convenience, the application will also facilitate the purchase of relevant diet products directly from the website.
